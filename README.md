This is simply an example of how to query the PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM. 

Prisma is a modern, type-safe Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool designed for efficient database access. Key features include a type-safe query syntax, declarative schema definition, support for various databases, automatic migrations, real-time data sync, and performance optimization. Prisma seamlessly integrates with GraphQL APIs, has an active community, and is available as open source with cloud-based services for enhanced database management. It provides a robust and developer-friendly solution for modern backend development.

In the future, I plan to integrate it into an exciting new project.
